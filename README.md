# AntiXBLExploit

Simply checks for previous logins with a different XUID and letter case... Something that is fundamental to XBox Live that thankfully isn't broken.

## Caveats:
This means, if a player has not logged in yet and the hijacked IGN logs in first, the plugin will log that as the player's XUID.

To fix this, use the `/axxclear <playerName>` command and reset the last known XUID for that player.
